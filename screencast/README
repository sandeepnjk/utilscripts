screencast is a utility script using avconv of the libav project
to create quick screencasts.
For usage please type screencast -h.

The screencast videos will be created in the ./Videos folder.
Currently this script supports ubuntu only. mac osx and windoze version 
will be added. 


Requirements.
1. avconv
2. sox
3. libx264 by default (or what ever codec you may want :://todo)


sudo apt-get install libav-tools
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-53
sudo apt-get sox

Check for your codec. Eg:-
$avconv -codecs | grep "264"
You should see an output like below:-
avconv version 0.8.9-6:0.8.9-0ubuntu0.13.04.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the Libav developers

Additional Notes:
=== Background (optional)=== (ref: http://askubuntu.com/questions/432542/is-ffmpeg-missing-from-the-official-repositories-in-14-04)
You can use either ffmpeg or avconv. 
Ubuntu started shipping the libav fork instead of FFmpeg in recent releases. If you installed the ffmpeg package, then you actually installed the libav-tools package and a program that told you to use avconv instead of ffmpeg in the future, giving the impression that ffmpeg is deprecated, which it is not.

The transitional ffmpeg package seems to have been removed from trusty/Ubuntu 14.04, probably from 13.04 itself, (compare the package files listing for saucy and trusty of the source package). 

So one option is to install the libav-tools package and use avconv instead (NB that this is not "mainline" FFmpeg but a prominent fork instead).

For usage: 
screencast -h

script has been briefly tested on ubuntu 13.04.
