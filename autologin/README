Dependencies:
1. pass
2. gpg
3. beep (optional)


Setting up you password key store:

Step 1:
Briefly covering Ubuntu - Setting up Unix password manager
Reference: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-how-to-create-our-own-gnupg-privatepublic-key.html
To Install gpg
$sudo apt-get install gnupg

Step 2:
Creating a public private key.
$gpg --gen-key
#The above is an interactive program.Note: for kind of key choose the appropriate number shown for 'DSA and Elgamal'
Reference: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-how-to-create-our-own-gnupg-privatepublic-key.html

Step 3:
# Once completed Please notedown the keyId.
$gpg --list-keys
/home/sandeepn/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
---------------------------------
pub   2048D/1241847A 2014-04-15
uid                  Sandeep Nanajkar (sn) <sandeepnjk@gmail.com>
sub   2048g/63A9AA88 2014-04-15

ie... 1241847A is my gpg KeyID.

Step 4:
#Install the Password Manager ie. pass
- What is pass?
  With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
- Why is pass required here?
  autolog needs the user password to login. As autolog is a non-interactive tool (used by crontab) the script will pickup the password from the Password Manager (i.e pass).
- Reference: http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/
- Sidenote(optional): pass is git aware. so your gpg encrypted file(s) could reside on your git repo. (check Reference)

Install pass 
$sudo apt-get install pass
Update .bashrc to run the ../password-store script to ensure bash completion for pass command. 
$echo "source /etc/bash_completion.d/password-store" >> ~/.bashrc

Step 5:
Initializing the pass
$pass init "give your gpg key id here"
eg:- $pass init "1241847A"

Step 6:
Adding password to the password store.
$pass insert Business/imaginea/ldap/pass
Enter password for Business/imaginea/ldap/pass:

Step 7:
To view your Password Store Structure
$pass
Password Store
`-- Business
    `-- imaginea
        |-- ldap
        `-- quickbas

Step 8:
Install beep (optional) - Will beep briefly if autologin fails.
$sudo apt-get install beep
$sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
Comment out line that says blacklist pcspkr so it looks like this:
# ugly and loud noise, getting on everyone's nerves; this should be done by a
# nice pulseaudio bing (Ubuntu: #77010)
# blacklist pcspkr
